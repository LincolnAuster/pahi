Non-cryptographic randomness, but it's fed with cryptographic randomness anyways.

## result

**Parameters:**

None

**Returns:**

- `result`: i32 (int)

**Effects:** Consumes cryptographic entropy, might block while that is refilling.

**Semantics:**

A sufficiently random result value is returned.

**Errors:**

None
